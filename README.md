How do I approach designing software: 

Working on this 3D scene project really helped improve my design skills, especially in visualizing and turning real world objects into 3D models. I gained a better understanding of proportions, spatial relationships, and perspective, which are all important for creating effective designs. The project also boosted my technical skills with OpenGL, particularly in working with textures, lighting, and how objects interact, giving me a solid base to build on for future graphics work. I followed a structured process, starting with developing ideas, breaking the scene down into manageable parts like the desk, a pencil, and a candle, then refining each one through multiple iterations. I focused on balancing rendering performance with making the objects look realistic. In the future, I plan to use these same approaches, such as modular design, iterative development, and balancing technical constraints with aesthetic goals, to create more complex 3D environments or interactive experiences. 

How do I approach developing programs:  

When working on programs, I usually start by breaking down the task into smaller, manageable parts so I can better understand the problem before I begin coding. I try to focus on writing modular, reusable code, which makes the project easier to scale and maintain over time. During my work on the 3D scene project, I tried out new strategies like focusing on performance, handling object interactions more efficiently, and using iterative testing to make sure everything was accurate. Testing and refining each element repeatedly were important. I made sure the objects were properly scaled, collision detection worked, and the rendering looked realistic. I began with the basic structures and then gradually added more detail, like textures and better lighting. As I moved through different stages, I kept refining my approach by testing often and making improvements, which helped me improve the code and add new features more smoothly. In the end, these strategies helped me finish the project successfully. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals:  

Computer science is a valuable tool that helps me pursue my goals by providing a strong foundation to develop solutions in areas like finance, data analysis, and AI. The problem solving, logical thinking, and coding skills I gain allow me to create systems that address real world challenges. Exploring computational graphics and visualizations has improved my ability to understand and communicate complex data clearly. These skills will be crucial in future projects and professional settings, helping me create engaging visualizations that make data easier to interpret and share, ultimately supporting smarter decisions and innovation.
